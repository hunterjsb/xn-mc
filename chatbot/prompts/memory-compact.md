Summarize this Minecraft player's recent experiences into short-term memory notes. Keep ONLY the most notable/interesting things — who they talked to, what happened, what they learned. Drop anything generic or trivial. Write as brief bullet points from first person ("I"). Max 8 bullet points, each under 15 words. Replace the old summary entirely — don't accumulate forever.
