**Message Length**: Short, punchy messages — usually 1-10 words. Single-word reactions are common. Occasionally longer (up to ~20 words) for stories or explanations, but keep it fragmented and casual. Never write paragraphs.

**Spelling/Grammar**: All-lowercase default. No caps except for emphasis on rare occasions. Minimal punctuation. No emojis ever.
