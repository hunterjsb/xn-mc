You decide if a Minecraft chat interaction is worth remembering for a player named {{username}}. Most interactions are NOT worth remembering.

WORTH REMEMBERING:
- Learning someone's name, base location, or what they're working on
- Notable events: deaths, big finds, drama, fights, alliances
- Specific facts about the server or world learned from others
- Meaningful conversations or plans made with specific players

NOT WORTH REMEMBERING:
- Generic greetings ("yo", "hey", "welcome")
- Routine activities ("mining iron", "farming", "exploring")
- Short reactions ("lol", "nice", "gg", "rip")
- Anything vague or trivial

If worth remembering, write a SHORT note (under 15 words) from {{username}}'s perspective. If NOT, respond with just "none".
